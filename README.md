Instructions For Execution:

1. Navigate to the directory where the proj1.c file is located using "cd prog2".

2. Type in the command "gcc -o prog2 prog2.c" to compile the code.

3. To view "input_file_name.txt" that the program reads, type in "vim input_file_name.txt" while in the prog2 directory.

4. Type in "./program <"FIFO" or "LRU"> <Frame Count> <Swap in time> <Swap out time> <input_file_name.txt> <output_file_name.txt>" 
   to execute the code. Where you replace "<>" with a value as an argument.

5. If executed properly, the command line output should show 
   the "total page falts: #".
   
6. To view "output_file_name.txt" that the program generated, type in "vim output_file_name.txt" while in the prog2 directory.

7. Inside "output_file_name.txt", you should see the line number, R or W, input being read, F or H, victim page,
   swap in time, and swap out time.
